# Code of Shadows: A Sam Grey Mystery
This is my portfolio project for CS 101: Introduction to Programming. It is a Choose Your Own Adventure terminal based game written in Python. 

## Execution
To RUN invoke python on the main file.
> python main.py

## Scope
One player plays as Sam Grey's junior detective assistant acting as their trusted companion and sidekick, adding an interactive and immersive element to the choose-your-own-adventure experience. 

This dynamic allows the user to actively participate in the investigation, make choices, and contribute to the unfolding of the story alongside Sam Grey. Similar to the partnership between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, the user's character can provide valuable insights, support, and assistance to Sam Grey as they navigate through the mysteries and challenges they encounter. This role offers an exciting opportunity for readers to engage with the story and shape its outcome, making the adventure even more captivating and interactive.

## Goal
Have a player go through a mystery story and make choices that impact the storyline.
